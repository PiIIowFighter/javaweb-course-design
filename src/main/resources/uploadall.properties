# Upload base directory (absolute path recommended)
#
# Tips:
# 1) After deployment (WAR unpacked), you can edit this file at:
#    /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/Online_SMsystem5SP/WEB-INF/classes/upload.properties
# 2) Or use an external config to avoid being overwritten when redeploying:
#    -Dupload.config=/etc/onlinesm/upload.properties
#    or env: UPLOAD_CONFIG=/etc/onlinesm/upload.properties
# 3) You can also override by JVM property: -Dupload.baseDir=...
#    or env: UPLOAD_BASE_DIR=...

upload.baseDir=/var/lib/tomcat9/uploads

# Subdirectories under baseDir
upload.avatarSubDir=avatars
upload.resumeSubDir=resumes

# Legacy folder name (older versions used: <base>/profile)
# Keep it here for backward compatibility (read old files).
upload.legacyProfileDir=profile


upload.baseDir=D:/upload
upload.avatarSubDir=avatars
upload.resumeSubDir=resumes
upload.legacyProfileDir=profile
